					<h1>Accept yourself as you are.</h1>
					<p> Remember that you are running your own race.
						Try not to compare your life and what it looks like right 
						now to anyone else’s. When you start comparing yourself to 
						others, it’s easy to feel inadequate, which makes it hard to 
						even take the very first step in self-care. Instead, try your 
						best to accept the person that you are and where you are in life
						right now. </p>

					<h1>Find what makes you happy. </h1>
					<p> If you`re caught up in taking care of all
						of your responsibilities — rather than taking 
						care of yourself — you may not even really
						know what kind of self-care you need.
						What works for someone else may not work for you.
						Take time to think about what things you
						can do to make yourself feel happy or 
						accomplished and include them in building the
						self-care routine that makes the most
						sense for you, your schedule, and your
						health overall. </p>
